								<p>UWHScores.com is a system for tracking results of underwater hockey
								tournaments. It tracks the scores and calculates standings in real time. The schedule dynamically
								updates to fill seeds and winners/losers into the bracket so you'll always know who is playing
								when.</p>
								<p>UWHScores.com is designed to make the lives of tournament directors easier and give players an
								easy interface to follow their team's progress through the schedule.</p>

									<li>Pod</li>
									<li>Team</li>

								<p>The standings update in real time as the games progress and include tie breakers. This way players can better
								understand where their team stands and what the potential brackets might look like.</p>
								<p>
								In addition to division, pod and team name, the fields on the standing are:
								<ul>
									<li> Rank - Where a team currently stands among the division or pod. Two teams may have the same rank if they are currently fully tied (see below for how ties are broken).</li>
									<li> Points - The number of points the team has earned. Teams are ranked by points. A team earns three points for each win and one point for a tie.</li>
									<li> Record - Win-Loss-Tie record for only the games in the division/pod that the standings are calculated.</li>
									<li> GA - Goals Allowed during the games for the division or pod played for points in the standing. Goals allowed is used as a tie-breaker if necessary. </li>
									<li> GP - Games Played. Number of games the team has played in this division/pod. This only counts the games that will go towards points in the standing.</li>
									<li> Overall - Win-Loss-Tie record for the whole tournament, includes current set of games as well as any previous pods and bracket play. </li>

						</h2>
						<div id="answer-collapse4" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="question-heading4" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordian">
							<div class="accordion-body">
								<p>Teams are ranked by the number of points they have earned (wins and ties). If two teams have the same number of points
								then the tie will be broken according to the CMAS Underwater Hockey Competition Procedures v1.0 rule 3.7<p>
								<p>If two teams are tied in ranking, the tie breaking procedure is as follows:
								<ul>
									<li>Head to head competition</li>
									<li>Most number of wins in the intra-section matches. Team with the most wins is ranked higher.</li>
									<li>Least number of losses. Team with the least losses is ranked higher.</li>
									<li>Least sum of points allowed in all matches in the intra-section matches. Team allowing the least number of goals is ranked higher.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If none of the above can break the tie, the tie will be broken by a coin toss or some other method as directed
								by the tournament director or head referee.</p>
								<p>
								The standings reflect the tie-breakers in real time (except coin-flip for obvious reason). This means they can change as
								the day progresses and things unfold. The standings are not final till all the games in a section have been played.

								<p>In the event that three teams have the same number of points at the end or round-robin play for a division or pod
								the tie will again be broken according to the CMAS Underwater Hockey Competition Procedures v1.0 rule 3.7.2<p>
								<p>The rule states that if three teams are tied and no clear winner from head-to-head can be determined
								(that is only one team beat the other two), the two-way tie breakers will be applied in order except head-to-head. One team will be
								separated from the other two as either the top or bottom team. The remaining two teams then restart the tie-breaking sequence
								for two teams as covered by rule 3.7.</p>
								<p>For example, if three teams were tied on points and had the same number of wins and losses then goals allowed
								would be used. The team with the most goals allowed would become recieve the lowest rank of the three. The remaining two teams would
								then be compared again starting with head-to-head competition for first and second rank.</p>
								<p>If none of the above can break the tie, the tie will be broken by a three-way coin flip or some other method as directed
								by the tournament director or head referee.</p>

								<p>First, because those are the rules, it is not a decision of this site. For more info on the tie breaker rules, see above.</p>
								<p>The rules are setup to discourage teams from running up the score against a weaker opponent.</p>
								<p>If ties were broken on goal differential or most goals it would benefit a team to run up as many goals as possible against
								a weak team to help them in the tie break later. That's no fun.</p>
