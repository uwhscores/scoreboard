# FAQ
**Q:** How do I get to use UWHScores.com?

**A:** I developed UWHScores.com to help develop the sport of UWH, but running it for each tournament takes time, effort and care. If you are interested in having UWHScores.com for your tournament, reach out to me. Odds are I will be happy to run it, but please appreciate my time and respect that it just might not work. Over time, as the platform matures it will be easier and easier to run tournaments, but we aren't there yet. 

**Q:** How do I provide the schedule and teams?

**A:** The system works by importing CSV files for the schedule and teams. These CSV files are usually pretty easy to generate out of the types of Excels people are used to creating for tournaments. If a little care is given in advance in creating the Excel sheets, exporting to CSV can be nearly automatic. Even if not, it usually doesn't take too long to munge the data. 

Team names are stored in a separate CSV file so they can be added later after the schedule is final. 

More detailed information on the CSV formats will be provided as soon as we start working together. 

**Q:** What types of tournament format does the system support?

**A:** The system is pretty flexible. Currently it can support almost any type of round-robin that feeds into a bracket and support multiple divisions including double-round robins. It can mostly support pods but I will need extra time to ensure everything is correct as pod play can be very delicate. Recently some tournaments have started a "replacement round-robin" type tournament, it can support that but it requires manual intervention. 

The best thing is to contact me early and help me understand the layout, I can work with the system to get it done. 

**Q:** How are scores entered during the tournament?

**A:** During the tournament scores can be entered through a webpage from any device that has access to the internet. This could be a phone, tablet or laptop. Entering the scores requires no special skills or knowledge. If you can browse Facebook you can enter scores. The update page is protected by a tournament specific password to keep players from being bad. 

**Q:** Are my scores still available after the tournament?

**A:** Currently the system can only display one tournament at a time. The scores from any tournament usually stay online until the next one starts to go live, after that they can't be seen on the webpage. However, I do save all the tournament results and I am working on an archive view that will allow for checking in on past tournaments.
